# Multiply the number

# Requisites:

Write a function that multiplies the number by 5 to power of the length of the number

## How should we do it?

- Get the length of the number
- Multiply it by 5
- JS uses `**` for exponentiation or Math.pow
- When it comes to negative numbers we need to account for the `-` sign, thus we need to reduce the length by 1
